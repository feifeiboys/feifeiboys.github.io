1.1 True or false? 
- (a) All photons have the same energy. 
- (b) As the frequency of light increases, its wavelength decreases. 
- (c) If violet light with l = 400 nm does not cause the photoelectric effect in a certain metal, then it is certain that red light with l = 700 nm will not cause the photoelectric effect in that metal. 

1.2 (a) Calculate the energy of one photon of infrared radiation whose wavelength is 1064 nm. (b)  An Nd:YAG laser emits a pulse of 1064-nm radiation of average power 5 * 106 W and duration 2 * 10-8 s. Find the number of photons emitted in this pulse. (Recall that 1 W = 1 J>s.) 

1.3 Calculate the energy of one mole of UV photons of wavelength 300 nm and compare it with a typical single-bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. 

1.4 The work function of very pure Na is 2.75 eV, where 1 eV = 1.602 * 10-19 J. (a) Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons emitted from Na exposed to 200 nm ultraviolet radiation. (b) Calculate the longest wavelength that will cause the photoelectric effect in pure Na. (c) The work function of sodium that has not been very carefully purified is substantially less than 2.75 eV, because of adsorbed sulfur and other substances derived from atmospheric gases. When impure Na is exposed to 200-nm radiation, will the maximum photoelectron kinetic energy be less than or greater than that for pure Na exposed to 200-nm radiation? 

1.5 (a) Verify that at high frequencies Wien’s law is a good approximation to Planck’s blackbody equation. (b) In June 1900 Rayleigh applied the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics to derive an equation for blackbody radiation that showed the radiation intensity to be proportional to n2T. In 1905, Jeans pointed out an error in Rayleigh’s derivation of the proportionality constant and corrected the Rayleigh formula to I = 2pn2kT>c2. Show that at low frequencies, Planck’s blackbody formula can be approximated by the Rayleigh–Jeans formula. Hint: Look up the Taylor series expansion of ex in powers of x. (The classicalmechanical Rayleigh–Jeans result is physically absurd, since it predicts the emitted energy to increase without limit as n increases.) 

1.6 Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at 1>137th the speed of light. (At this speed, the relativistic correction to the mass is negligible.) 

1.7 Integrate the equation dx>dt = - gt + gt0 + v 0 in the paragraph after Eq. (1.11) to find x as a function of time. Use the condition that the particle was at x0 at time t0 to evaluate the integration constant and show that x = x0 - 12 g1t - t022 + v 01t - t02. 

1.8 A certain one-particle, one-dimensional system has  = ae-ibte-bmx2>U, where a and b are constants and m is the particle’s mass. Find the potential-energy function V for this system. Hint: Use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. 

1.9 True or false? (a) For all quantum-mechanical states, 0 1x, t2 0 2 = 0 c1x2 0 2. (b) For all quantum-mechanical states, 1x, t2 is the product of a function of x and a function of t. 

1.10 A certain one-particle, one-dimensional system has the potential energy V = 2c2 U2x2>m and is in a stationary state with c1x2 = bxe-cx2, where b is a constant, c = 2.00 nm-2, and m = 1.00 * 10-27 g. Find the particle’s energy.
