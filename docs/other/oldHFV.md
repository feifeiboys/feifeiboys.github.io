## 介绍HMO
- HMO是什么
Hückel molecular orbital theory (HMO), as the first and simplest approximation in a hierarchy of semiempirical methods a posteriori to ab initio quantum chemistry approaches, still plays an irreplaceable role in chemistry.
- 重要性
For two reasons, the HMO approximation can prolong its impact over the years.
	- 形式/求解简单
	On one hand, it gives a simple interpretation to molecular orbital (MO) theory, since several systems have closed analytical solutions.
	However, MO energies and wave function coefficients, traditionally computed by solving polynomial equations using the method of secular determinants in linear variational theory, yield excellent qualitative insights into the behavior of hydrocarbons with π bonds, including predictions of delocalization, aromaticity, π bond order, etc.
	- 易于教学
	On the other hand, even more importantly, the HMO model is widely adopted in chemical education.
	Thus, the theory has been an evergreen in introducing students to quantum chemistry, given its distinguished history as one of the first methods for computing such properties for conjugated hydrocarbons, long before the advent of modern electronic computers.
	It is also easy for students to connect the material with their prior knowledge and insights gained in other chemistry courses that they may have taken.
	This remarkable reputation was accumulated via the contributions from some outstanding scientists as Lennard-Jones, Coulson and Longuet-Higgins, Ruedenberg, Hoffman, Shaik, and Kutzelnigg, etc. Even in contemporary chemistry, the Hückel approach is still very useful for learning chemical concepts on a sound basis.
- 发展
For example, by using the Hückel mnemonics, Shaik has proposed a qualitative valence bond (VB) model to show that VB theory does not fail to reproduce the rules of aromaticity and antiaromaticity.
Later in the monograph on VB theory, Shaik and Hiberty use the same mnemonics to further demonstrate that VB theory reproduces also the photoelectron spectrum of methane. 
Recently, based on the Hückel methodology, Humbel has developed the Hückel Lewis configuration interaction method to recast the concept of Lewis structures into the Hückel formalism.
